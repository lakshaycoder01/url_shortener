# Flask url shortener

A simple URL shortner where a User enters a URL like http://google.com , it generates shorten URL like http://zyla/<hash>

Data about original url and their hash are being stored in urls.csv file

So when user come in and type same original url it will give same shorten url by checking it from urls.csv
